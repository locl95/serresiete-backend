# Changelog
## [4.2.1] 12-12-2024

### Added
- **Featured Filter for Get Views Endpoint**: Added a new filter to the Get Views endpoint, enabling the retrieval of featured views from all games or a specific game. This enhancement allows users to quickly access highlighted views.

## [4.2.0] 15-11-2024

### Added
- **WoW Hardcore Views**: Introduced support for **World of Warcraft Hardcore Views**, allowing users to create and manage views specifically for hardcore characters.
- **Event Sourcing for WoW Characters**: Synchronization for WoW characters, including **Mythic+** and **Hardcore**, is now handled via event sourcing, improving efficiency and scalability.

## [4.1.1] 15-11-2024

### Added
- **Game-Based View Filtering**: Introduced a new filter to retrieve views specific to a particular game.
    - This enhancement improves user experience by allowing targeted retrieval of views for games like "World of Warcraft" or "League of Legends."

## [4.1.0] 12-11-2024

### Changed
- **Credentials System Update**: Enhanced the credentials management system with new requirements and modifications:
    - **Create Credential**: Now requires a set of roles to be provided in the request, ensuring that each credential is created with defined permissions.
    - **Edit Credential**: Endpoint updated to `/credentials/{user}` (previously `/credentials`). This operation now requires both `password` and `roles` to be included in the request.
    - **Patch Credential**: Introduced a new `PATCH` endpoint for credentials, similar to the edit functionality but with flexibility—fields such as `password` and `roles` can be optionally included.

### Removed
- **Activity and Role Management**: Removed the ability to create or delete activities and roles directly, streamlining the credential's system.

## [4.0.1] 10-11-2024
### Changed
- **League of Legends Background Sync**: Now league of legend background sync is optimized and only syncs characters that have not been synced by any other source.

## [4.0.0] 09-11-2024
### Added
- **Event Sourcing Implementation**: Introduced a major architecture change with event sourcing for resource management. Previously, creating large views was not sustainable, as it required waiting for external systems to respond before proceeding. Now, when a user creates a view, an operation is queued, and an operation ID is returned, which will be used to track the status of the requested action over the resource.
- **View Creation Process**: Views will be created once the subscriptions process the queued events, improving the overall efficiency of resource handling and allowing for better scalability.
- **Queue System for Syncing League of Legends Characters**: League of Legends view updates now send characters for updates via queues, in addition to the background task. This ensures that views can be populated faster, as characters receive individual updates immediately, instead of waiting for a scheduled or forced background task to run.

### Changed
- **JWT-Based Authentication System**: Replaced the existing token system with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to enhance authentication efficiency and reduce database load.
    - **Self-Contained Permissions**: Permissions are now embedded directly within the JWT, removing the need to query the database for permission checks on each request.
    - **Improved Performance**: This change significantly improves response times for authenticated requests by reducing dependency on database lookups for role-based access validation.
    - **Security Enhancements**: JWTs are securely signed, ensuring token authenticity and integrity without frequent database validation.

## [3.5.1] 04-11-2024

### Added
- **Character Limit by Role in Views**: Introduced a new feature that limits the maximum number of characters allowed per view based on user roles.

## [3.5.0] 03-11-2024

### Added
- Introduced a daily update for League characters to refresh summoner details, including summoner icon, summoner level, Riot name, and Riot tag every 24 hours.
- Optimized further the League Character's Sync by allowing the reuse of match data across multiple players in the same synchronization batch, leveraging dynamic programming to minimize calls. While this may not drastically increase capacity, it significantly improves efficiency in the synchronization process.

### Changed
- Updated the `getData` and `getCachedData` endpoints to include the `viewName` in the response. This change may break integration with existing frontends expecting the previous response format.

## [3.4.1] 01-11-2024

- **Query Parameter Validation**: Added validation for query parameters to ensure data integrity and prevent potential errors.

## [3.2.0] 28-10-2024

### Changed

  field is required in both create and edit requests for views.
- **Character Request Types**: Specified that the types `com.kos.characters.WowCharacterRequest`
  and `com.kos.characters.LolCharacterRequest` need to be sent as part of the view requests when adding characters due
  to a software limitation.

## [1.3.0] 30-09-2024

### Added

- **Background Task Execution Results Registration**: Enhanced the existing background task execution logging by now
  registering the results of each execution in the database.
    - This addition allows for detailed tracking of task outcomes, improving the monitoring and analysis capabilities of
      background processes.
